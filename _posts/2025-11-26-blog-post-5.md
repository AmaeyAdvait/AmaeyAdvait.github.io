"You are smarter than your data. Data do not understand causes and effects; humans do.”
 *~Judea Pearl, The Book of Why*

I remember watching a  cartoons when I was younger. One of my absolute favourites was this japanese cartoon named 'Doraemon', which is the name of a robot cat which comes from the future to help a boy in his daily life. The plot of the cartoon had many impossible elements, but every time I used to watch it, I still remember feeling intrigued as to how a robot could be so much smarter than a human in a broad lens. It feels weird to admit it, but I believe it was my first foray into what AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) should resemble. 

It's hard to exactly visualise what an AGI should look like but I like to think of it as a self credible, curious machine. More on this in a later post.
