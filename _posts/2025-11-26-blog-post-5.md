"You are smarter than your data. Data do not understand causes and effects; humans do.”
 *~Judea Pearl, The Book of Why*

I have always been a bookworm for as long as I can remember, but I do remember watching a few cartoons when I was younger. One of my absolute favourites was this japanese cartoon named 'Doraemon', which is the name of a robot cat which comes from the future to help a boy in his daily life. The plot of the cartoon had many impossible elements, but every time I used to watch it, I still remember feeling intrigued as to how a robot could be so much smarter than a human in the broad lens of the show. 

It's hard to exactly visualise what an AGI should look like but I like to think of **self credible curioity** as a necessary trait. 

'Self credible' refers to a sense of identity along with a sense of understanding what it means to follow through. This is important because it does not suffice that a machine is hard coded to follow a certain set of rules or instructions. There will always be some measures of the present which the introspective engineers of the future will need to modify according to the progressing social aspects and norms of humanity. Building credibility must begin not in our perception of the machine designed, but in the design of the machine itself.
