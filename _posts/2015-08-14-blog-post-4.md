"...You had a point about language. When you get right down to it, it’s a work-around. Like trying to describe dreams with smoke signals. It’s noble, it’s maybe the most noble thing a body can do but you can’t turn a sunset into a string of grunts without losing something."

NeuroAI Systems (Part 3)
========================

Every human can produce and understand different combinations of words that they haven't read or heard before. This almost certainly implies that our brains must have some programme that can build infinite sentences out of finite words. It's interesting to observe that we usually pay attention to what we are saying, but often neglect how we are saying it.

Ok, but why consider Natural Language Processing as a NeuroAI system? Because language is a wonderful embodiment of 'tacit' intelligence in the brain.

Let me explain.

Language is the bridge between thought and action. From the time I was a young child, I remember being fascinated by words, stories and the human brain's wonderful ability to piece together complex thoughts into meaningful strings. It is the purest element of any civilisation and without a doubt, the most essential as well. But while large language models and similar paradigms have managed to crack the enigma of language to convincingly show that language is not a uniquely human ability, we still have close to no understanding of how we can simulate thought. 

I believe this could be due to the inherently static nature of language. While
