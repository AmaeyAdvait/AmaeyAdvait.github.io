“Electronic circuits are millions of times faster than our biological circuits. At first we will have to devote all of this speed increase to compensating for the relative lack of parallelism in our computers, but ultimately the digital neocortex will be much faster than the biological variety and will only continue to increase in speed.”

NeuroAI Systems(Part 1)
=======================

When we think about a system in electronics, we are always interested in finding its transfer function, power spectral density etc. But the crucial idea that tends to get missed is that at a fundamental level, the system exists without the signal and the signal exists without the system. In other terms, the signal and the system are indpendent of each other. Always. 

Yet, it seems hard to make sense of one without the other. For example, the neocortex is known to be active even without input, which is crucial for memory consolidation, but its predictions remain idle in a world where the information an event carries is inversely proportional to the probability of its occurence. On the flipside, many signals generated from various sources may exist in the vacuum of space, never passing through a brain and thus serving as remnants of un-interpreted possibilities. 

Thus, I believe that intelligence is deeply rooted in enactive cognition/predictive coding, which removes the focus from the system or the signal and places it on the interaction and embodiment between the two.

This is why neuromorphic computing is such a powerful tool. Rather than trying to build a system that characterizes the signal to noise ratio or other properties, researchers are trying to map the features of the brain onto a silicon wafer, to condense the working of tens pf thousands of neurons into a very small area. 

It is a pivotal step in visualising the shift of focus from AI(the signal) or the brain(the system) to their integrated response. With improved efficiency and temporal reasoning, neuromorphic computing is the key substrate that closes the virtuous feedback loop of NeuroAI.
