"The human brain is, after all, the best example we have of an intelligent system. If we can learn its methods, we can use these biologically inspired paradigms to build more intelligent machines."
                  *~Von Neumann, The Computer and the Brain*

NeuroAI Systems (Part 2)
========================

I remember watching a ton of cartoons when I was younger. One of my absolute favourites was this japanese cartoon named 'Doraemon', which is the name of a robot cat which comes from the future to help a boy in his daily life. The plot of the cartoon had many impossible elements, but every time I used to watch it, I still remember feeling intrigued as to how a robot could be so much smarter than a human in a broad lens. It feels weird to admit it, but I believe it was my first foray into what AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) should resemble. 

It's hard to exactly visualise what an AGI should look like but I like to think of it as a self credible, curious machine. More on this in a later post.
