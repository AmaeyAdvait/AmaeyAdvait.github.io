"The human brain is, after all, the best example we have of an intelligent system. If we can learn its methods, we can use these biologically inspired paradigms to build more intelligent machines."
                  *~Von Neumann, The Computer and the Brain*

***This blog post is designed to give a pithy perspective into the fascinating world of Cognitive Robotics and what it specifically means to me.***

NeuroAI Systems (Part 2)
========================

Feedback. 

It's a ubiquitous term. It's also understandingly very powerful in circuits and control, but what makes it so?

I had the wonderful opportunity to experiment in the analog circuits lab in my third semester. My first experience in feedback actually occured just over a month ago in the same lab. Two weeks prior to that day, I had burnt my hand(only slightly) when my lab partner and I were tinkering with a CL100 transistor in the process of building an audio amplifier. At the end of that lab, our oscilloscope showed the same dreaded noisy sine wave, with no tangible output emnating from the speaker. 

It felt excruciatingly tiring, knowing every time entering the lab that there will be some deviation from the expected results. I couldn't understnad why somebody hadn't come up with a tangible solution. So imagine my surprise when we were successfully able to design an RC phase shift oscillator in under two hours during the next lab! The output was exceptionally table and the target frequency was exactly what we had calculated it to be.

From the perspective of an introspective engineer, it made me curious as to why negative feedback has such a drastic impact on the stability of a signal. Why does repeatedly subtracting a portion of the output from the input give us a much better output?

Some properties of negative feedback that help it achieve stability are gain desensitization, bandwisth extension, modification of input-output impedances and higher linearity. But the true error reduction lies in its sensing and return mechanisms. 

It's really simple to break down cognitive robotics into two feedback circuits: Physical and Cognitive. On one side, sensors essentially detect not just the input signals, but also the result of the actuator's feedback to it, thus enabling the robots to learn from its own mistakes in the physical world. The Cognitive feedback loop is reinforcement learning, which enables the robots to learn from its own mistakes in its decision making.


A Strategic Thought Experiment
==============================

As a passionate chess player who has played the sport for more than a decade now, I cannot deny the enormous change that chess engines have brought into the landscape. It's fascinating to see many chess engines like Stockfish used daily by many professional and rising players in the chess community. 

In the last decade, advances by Google DeepMind and some other research labs using self reinforcement learning have managed to solve many of the 2 player games. Further, researchers have been able to create not just narrow but also general proficiency in such scenarios. However, in recent years, there is one other variant of chess that has begun to gain traction. In accordance with the same, consider the following scenario:-

*"<u>4 Player Chess</u>: Multi agent systems are quickly improving in the perspective of creating simulated worlds incorporating vision, sound and other senses. However, very few of them currently focus on improving intelligence in the simulated world, which is crucial in understanding how to simulate the brain. To do this requires some insights from game theory, and 4 player chess is a great example. How could one go about designing an engine that optimizes for a single agent's success? Could we also create a 4 player chess puzzle solver to solve puzzles like the one attached below?
