Hi! I'm Amaey Advait, a second year undergraduate student studying Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, India. As an introspective engineer with a penchant for solving complex problems, I strive to be creative and efficient in finding their solutions. 

Currently, my research goal is to build robust, reliable systems that bridge minds and machines. To move the needle in the right direction, I aim to explore the foundations of curiosity and self-credibility in learning models and design algorithms to enhance these traits while fixing vulnerabilities in their abstractions.

If I had to define myself in one sentence: 
*I am a constructive reflection of my past, present and future.*
